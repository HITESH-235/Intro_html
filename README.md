# <h1>Lists_In_html</h1>

Html lists allows us to add several items of a kind to one group. 

<h3>Unordered Lists :</h3>
<div>An unordered list starts with the "ul" tag. Every list item starts with the "li" tag(applies for other types too). The list items will be marked with bullets.</div>

<h3>Ordered List :</h3>
<div>An ordered list starts with the "ol" tag. The list items will be marked with numbers by default.</div>

<h3>Description Lists</h3>
<div>A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term. The "dl" tag defines the description list, the "dt" tag defines the term (name), and the "dd" tag describes each term.</div>
